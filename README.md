## Introduction

PleasureCraft is a highly detailed and immersive sexual mod for Minecraft that expands the gameplay beyond simple combat and exploration.  It’s designed to encourage players to engage with their partners in a more sensual and emotional way, offering a rich and layered experience focused on intimacy, affection, and shared pleasure.  This mod isn’t just about physical intimacy; it’s about building a shared experience of connection, vulnerability, and desire.

## Key Features & Mechanics

* **Dynamic Weather Effects:**  The core of PleasureCraft is a system of dynamic weather effects that significantly impact the mood and atmosphere.  Rain, moonlight, and even a gentle warmth can dramatically affect the feelings of the players, encouraging a more relaxed and receptive environment.
* **Emotion-Based Lighting:**  The lighting system is heavily influenced by player emotions.  Feeling joyful, affectionate, or even a little bit nervous will result in softer, warmer lighting, subtly guiding players towards a more comfortable state.
* **Interactive Objects:**  We’ve introduced a variety of interactive objects – flowers, logs, banners, and even a small, gentle pool – that players can interact with to create a sense of shared experience and build towards intimacy.
* **Relationship-Based Dialogue:**  The mod includes a system of dialogue that subtly shifts based on the relationship between the players.  Early interactions are simple and focused on establishing connection, while later interactions introduce more complex emotions and desires.
* **Customizable Zones:**  Players can create and customize their own zones, adding unique elements and decorations to enhance the atmosphere and tailor the experience to their preferences.
* **Music Integration:**  We’ve incorporated a collection of ambient music tracks designed to enhance the mood and create a romantic or playful atmosphere.

## Gameplay & How to Play

1. **Installation:** Simply place the PleasureCraft folder into your Minecraft world’s resource pack folder.
2. **Initial Setup:**  The initial setup involves setting up the key locations (e.g., the Garden, the Forest, the Beach) and assigning them to different nodes.
3. **Dynamic Weather:**  The dynamic weather system is activated automatically by setting the "Weather" property of the nodes.
4. **Interaction with Objects:**  Players can interact with the interactive objects to trigger special events, such as flower blooming, a gentle ripple in the water, or a faint melody.
5. **Relationship Dialogue:**  The dialogue system is active by default, but can be toggled in the settings.
6. **Customization:**  Players can customize the appearance and functionality of the interactive objects and zones.
